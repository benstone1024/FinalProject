                hakur was born in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City but relocated to Los Angeles in 1988. When he released his debut
                album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop, introducing social issues in the
                genre at a time when gangsta rap was dominant in the mainstream.[5][6] Shakur achieved further critical and commercial
                success with Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995).[7] Later that year, after suffering
                legal troubles and a robbery and shooting, Shakur became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip
                hop rivalry.[8] His double-disc album, All Eyez on Me, which was released in 1996, later became one of the best-selling
                albums in the United States.[9] On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unknown assailant in a drive-by
                shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later and the gunman was never captured. Rapper The Notorious B.I.G., known
                for his feud with Shakur, was at first considered a suspect, but was also fatally shot in another drive-by shooting
                in Los Angeles several months later.[10][11] Five more albums have been released since his death, all of which have
                been certified platinum.
